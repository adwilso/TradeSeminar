Todo: 
- Take the results from the production function estimation to calculate the markup correctly



--- Using labour input, since a few of the computer firms are showing very low material consumption (mostly hosting firms),
    thus they have weird results. But they need labour and services

----- page 18 says that we shouldn't use m in the calculations of the production function, or if we do we can't use ACF 

 - How do we estimate the business model? Are we losing out to people choosing to not make a margin? 
    - Size of payroll
    - Ratio of materials expense to revenue (carrying inventory) 


-- We are using a gross output function because labour isn't flexibly choosen in Slovenia



-- Cash Control: Cash Flow ratio 
-----(Net operating cash / current liabilities) 

-- Operational Risk: Critical needs cash ratio 
---- (Net operating cash flow   + Interest Paid / Total Current Liabilities + Interest )

-- Profitability:  Operating Margin 
-- Efficiency: Assets turnover 
---- (Gross Revenue/Assets)
